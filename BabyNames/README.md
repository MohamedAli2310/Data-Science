Two separate ArrayLists are used to store the total numbers of all the male names and all the female names in all the files. Then these arrays are sorted in a descending order using sort() and reverse(). Then the search() method is used to find the total number in the array list equivalent to the input name's total number. Then the total rank can be retrieved from the index by adding 1 as the index starts from zero while the rank starts from 1.
